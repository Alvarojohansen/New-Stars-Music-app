        Our Story
      </Typography>
      <Typography className="mx-8 text-justify">
        We are a group of five friends from Argentina who share a deep passion
        for music and creativity. One day, we came up with the idea to create a
        space where music and merchandise could coexist, offering fans a unique
        shopping experience and giving artists a new way to reach their
        audience. After months of brainstorming and hard work, we brought this
        vision to life. Our mission is to create a community where artists and
        fans can connect through the power of music and merchandise. Thank you
        for being a part of our journey!
